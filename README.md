### Yet another place for self-promotion 🥳

I prefer to keep things as simple as possible.

🛳 Working on __[Loqbooq](https://loqbooq.app)__ — The decision log for your project!

🍄 Dabbling with __Unity, Monogame, and Heaps.io__

🌪 Writing __Swift__ code all day long

👾 side projects may appear occasionally on my Github timeline

⚡ Working at [Coding Friends](https://coding-friends.com), __contact us if you need support with iOS development__
